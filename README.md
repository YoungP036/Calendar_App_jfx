I'm running linux mint with the following:
    1. IntelliJ IDEA from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
    2. packages openjdk-8-jdk, openjdk-8-jre, openjfx
    3. Junit 4.12.jar, hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
    4. sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar 	


Testing started to feel a little wierd the further I got in this project. Many GUI features cannot be 
automatically tested so far as I know. The most challenging parts for me were figuring out how to work with the GUI.
