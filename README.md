    I'm running linux mint with the following:
        1. IntelliJ IDEA from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
        2. packages openjdk-8-jdk, openjdk-8-jre, openjfx
        3. Junit 4.12.jar, hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
        4. sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar 	

    You should be able to simply import this project into Intellij and run it via /src/Main. If the import is not clean you may
    need to edit class path to include the two .jar files in the root directory.
